# ABSA (Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis) — PLSA + TF-ICF + LSTM  
Full Multi-Aspect Pipeline with Streamlit App

This project implements a complete ABSA pipeline inspired by academic work on topic modeling and aspect expansion.  
It combines:

- **PLSA** — latent topic discovery  
- **TF-ICF (100%)** — expand vocabulary for each aspect cluster  
- **Semantic Similarity (AC3)** — map documents to canonical aspects  
- **GloVe Word Embedding + LSTM** — per-aspect (or mono) sentiment classifier  
- **Streamlit Application** — for interactive inference, visualization, and optional training  

The system predicts sentiment for **six canonical aspects**:
- Location  
- Service  
- Cleanliness  
- Sleep Quality  
- Mark (Overall Impression)  
- Like (Preference Indicator)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. (Optional) Create & activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m nltk.downloader punkt wordnet omw-1.4 averaged_perceptron_tagger stopwords
```

### 2. Download **GloVe 100d**  
Download from the official Stanford website:  
https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip

Extract and place:

```
data/external/glove.6B.100d.txt
```

### 3. Prepare your dataset  
Place your CSV at:

```
data/raw/reviews.csv
```

Required column:  
- `review_text` — the original review text  

Optional ground-truth columns:  
- `aspect` — one of the system aspects (location, cleanliness, service, etc.)  
- `sentiment` — 1=positive, 0=negative  

### 4. Train the full pipeline:
```bash
python -m src.pipeline_train --csv data/raw/reviews.csv
```

This runs:
- Text cleaning  
- PLSA topic modeling  
- TF-ICF aspect vocabulary expansion  
- Semantic similarity mapping  
- LSTM training per aspect (auto-skips if too few samples)

### 5. Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## 🌏 Indonesian Dataset Support
If your reviews are Indonesian:

1. Open:
```
src/config.py
```

2. Set:
```python
LANGUAGE = "id"
```

Indonesian mode includes:
- Sastrawi stemmer support (if installed)  
- NLTK Indonesian stopwords  
- Adapted tokenization  

If Sastrawi is missing, it falls back to a lightweight tokenizer.

## 📝 Notes
- If an aspect has **too few samples**, its LSTM model is skipped.  
- You may modify thresholds, PLSA topics, GloVe dimension, Top-K aspect selection, and other behaviors in:  
  ```
  src/config.py
  ```
- The inference engine supports:
  - Auto multi-aspect detection  
  - Cue-based boosting (cleanliness, service, location)  
  - Weighted overall review verdict  
  - Full 6-aspect tri-sentiment computation
